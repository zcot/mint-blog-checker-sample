General program overview:
1. Overall it's a status icon program, and shows a different colored icon for new blog entry
    -at any time the user can see the mint blog using xdg open method.
2. A timer loop is set to 6 hours for checking blog entry.
3. Code downloads mint blog file,
    -compares the date of the latest date to a previously saved date(or null date on first run),
    -with date difference then a green icon is shown, otherwise and orange icon(programmer's artwork).
